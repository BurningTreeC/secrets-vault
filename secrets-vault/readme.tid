! TiddlyWiki Secrets Vault Plugin

A highly secure secrets vault plugin for TiddlyWiki5 that uses the Web Crypto API and Shadow DOM for maximum security.

!! Features

!!! üîê Security First

* ''AES-256-GCM'' encryption with authenticated encryption
* ''PBKDF2-SHA256'' key derivation with 600,000 iterations (OWASP 2023)
* ''HMAC-SHA256'' additional integrity verification
* ''Shadow DOM'' isolation for sensitive UI components
* ''Constant-time'' comparison to prevent timing attacks
* ''Rate limiting'' with lockout after failed attempts

!!! üí° User-Friendly

* ''WikiText syntax'': `¬ß[secret:name]` to embed secrets
* ''Click to reveal'' secrets in your tiddlers
* ''Ctrl+Click'' (Cmd+Click on Mac) to copy without revealing
* ''Auto-hide'' secrets after configurable timeout (default 8 seconds)
* ''Editor toolbar'' integration for easy secret insertion
* ''Password change'' functionality without losing secrets

!!! üé® Adaptive UI

* Automatically adapts to TiddlyWiki color palettes
* Works seamlessly with dark and light themes
* Responsive design for all screen sizes

!! Usage

!!! Initial Setup

# Go to Control Panel ‚Üí Secrets Vault (or create a tiddler with `<$vault-manager/>`)
# Set a strong master password (minimum 8 characters)
# Click "Initialize Vault"

!!! Adding Secrets

# Unlock the vault with your master password
# Enter a name and value for your secret
# Click "Add Secret"

!!! Using Secrets in Tiddlers

To reference a secret in your tiddlers, use the syntax:

```
¬ß[secret:my-api-key]
¬ß[secret:password123]
```

This renders as a locked button:

* ''Click'' to reveal the secret
* ''Ctrl+Click'' (Cmd+Click on Mac) to copy directly to clipboard
* Secrets auto-hide after 8 seconds (configurable)

!!! Editor Toolbar

Use the üîê button in the editor toolbar to:

* Browse and insert existing secrets
* Access the vault manager

!! Security Implementation

!!! Encryption Details

* ''Algorithm'': AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
* ''Key Derivation'': PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations
* ''Salt'': 256-bit cryptographically secure random
* ''IV'': 128-bit random initialization vector per encryption
* ''Additional'': HMAC-SHA256 for integrity verification

!!! Security Features

* ''Non-extractable keys'': Crypto keys cannot be exported
* ''Memory clearing'': Automatic sensitive data cleanup
* ''Input sanitization'': Prevents injection attacks
* ''Replay protection'': Timestamps in encrypted data
* ''Rate limiting'': 5 attempts max, then 5-minute lockout

!!! Browser Requirements

* Web Crypto API support (all modern browsers)
* Shadow DOM support (recommended, with fallback)
* Works in single-file wikis opened locally (`file://` protocol)
* Also works on HTTPS sites and localhost

!! Configuration
